- periodically output some server status data to a text file, e.g. as an HTML table that can be included in a web viewable page 

- stop sending to hosts who haven't sent any messages for some time 
(it seems tricky to test if messages are successfully being sent over UDP)

- enable sending of string messages (might work already, haven't tested)

- enable 'send it right now' messages which an improviser can send to the server and will be immediately broadcast out to all improvisers

- some sort of 'wipe memory' capability?? tho it seems you can effectively enable this by sending in a large list of numbers e.g. if memlody memory 
size = 100 and an improviser sends in 100 numbers as a message, it does wipe the memory

- upgrade the 'message counts' feature which keeps a count of how many messages have been sent by imporovisers and ignores them after a certain 
threshold per cycle. The problem  is that an agent can send  a single message with lots of values in it and this registers as a single message, when 
it should count as <length of list> messages
