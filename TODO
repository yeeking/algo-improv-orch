- periodically output some server status data to a text file, e.g. as an HTML table that can be included in a web viewable page 

- stop sending to hosts who haven't sent any messages for some time 
(it seems tricky to test if messages are successfully being sent over UDP)

- enable sending of string messages (might work already, haven't tested)

MYK> I checked this out and it works. I have added a mood message to the config and an SC example. 

- enable 'send it right now' messages which an improviser can send to the server and will be immediately broadcast out to all improvisers

- upgrade the 'message counts' feature which keeps a count of how many messages have been sent by imporovisers and ignores them after a certain 
threshold per cycle. The problem  is that an agent can send  a single message with lots of values in it and this registers as a single message, when 
it should count as <length of list> messages. 

MYK> now it counts how many arguments are sent in a message 

- Maybe add a value to the config file to define the threshold for a message, i.e. how many of that type of message can be sent by an improviser 
before they are blocked till the next cycle...  e.g. lots of melody messages = good, lots of update clock messages maybe bad
