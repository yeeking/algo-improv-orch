The Algorithmic Improvisation Orchestra
========================================

This project, started by the members of http://strangeloop.co.uk aims to 
create software which enables the development of orchestras of 
co-improvising software 'agents'. 

This repository consists of the server (known as the conductor)  which 
mediates communication between the agents using the OSC protocol plus 
several example  agents written in various languages, including MAX/ 
MSP, Supercollider, Pure Data and Java.
