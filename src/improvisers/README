IMPLEMENTING AN IMPROVISER
=============================
To implement an improviser, you need to be able to send and receive OSC. 

The steps to take to register to receive messages from the server are:

- Connect to the server on port <8080> using UDP. (or whichever port you start it on...)

- Send an OSC message like this:

/hello 8081

(where 8081 is the port number your improviser listens on). The server will send messages back on that port. 

You can then start sending messages to the conductor. It understands all 
messages from the list in the config file. Note that you always need to send the port that your improviser 
is listening on. 

A message from the conductor might look like this:
/melody 1224, 245, 63.7, 543, 750.24

- the conductor is sending the improviser 5 values from its melody memory. 

A message to the conductor from an improviser might look like this:
/melody 8081, 123.414, 77.57

- an improviser is sending 5 new values to the conductor.
